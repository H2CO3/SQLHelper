Esay-to-use SQL helper class for simple, quick and easy database operations. Usage:

	SQLHelper *sqh = [[SQLHelper alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:@"SomeDB.sqlite3"];
	NSArray *rows = [sqh executeQuery:@"SELECT name, value FROM fruits"];
	for (NSDictionary *row in rows) {
		NSString *name = [row objectForKey:@"name"];
		NSNumber *value = [row objectForKey:@"value"];
		NSLog(@"%@ is worth $%@", name, value);
	}
	[sqh release];

Result:

	Orange is worth $100000
	Apple is worth $1000000000

etc.

The actual objects contained by a row dictionary can be NSString, NSNumber,
NSData and NSNull objects, depending on how the actual value was stored in
the SQLite database.
